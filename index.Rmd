# **About me**

![Me with a Savannah Sparrow (*Passerculus sandwichensis*)](Images/IMG_0636 2.jpg){width=25%}

### **Education**

- BA: Simpson College (2015)
- MS: University of South Dakota (2020)
- PhD: University of Tulsa (Current)

### **Research Projects**
I study birds! For my master's I studied the presence and physiology of birds at grassland stopover sites.  Currently, I study annual survival in Cliff Swallows by correlating features such as mass, tail length, and beak depth with probability of survival. To find out more about our research check out [The Brown Lab Website](https://www.cliffswallow.org). I was also a field tech for multiple grassland bird studies studying Dickcissels and interned as a hawk watcher at Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory.

### **Interests**

- Birds
- Avian conservation and ecology
